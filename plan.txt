   3.1 first based on evaluated RHS
   3.2 then based on some more general formulation probably based on harmonics
   3.3 this more general formulation take from Pascal code
   3.3a or maybe make a fully connected or convolutional layer to take harmonics into 
        account 
4. Make a table or errors on points (3 regions mentioned by IG...)
5.
